  <h1><em>Visualizations</em></h1>
  <h4><em>Bad Visualization</em></h4>
  <img src="FoxPieChart.jpg" alt="Fox new pie chart" align="center">
  <p>This is an example of a bad visualization of data. Above is a pie chart from
  Fox News. The use of the pie chart makes the data and statistics misleading. For 
  one, the percentages must be incorrect because they do not make up 100%. According
  to Cairo, this visualization would be first and foremost untruthful, which in and
  of itself deems it not a good visualization. Because of this it is also no functional,
  beautiful, insightful, or enlightening. Without proper information being visualized,
  this visualization does not make the cut for a good visualization.</p>
  <p>This visualization could be made better by first having proper statistics or at 
    least and explanation as to why percentages may not add up to 100%. Perhaps someone
    could be in two categories at the same time. If this is the case, a pie chart is 
    clearly not the best kind of graph to show this information. A Venn diagram could
    do better if this were to be the case.</p>

  <h4><em>Great Visualization</em></h4>
  <img src="Screen Shot 2019-02-18 at 4.37.02 PM.png" alt="Marvel Cinematic Universe website image" align="center">
  <p>This is an example of a “great” visualization technique in a website. 
    Pictured above is an example from a website on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
    This website shows all the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
    All the characters have an artistic bubble, which, if you click on, will 
    give information about the character, and a picture of the character. 
    From here, the user can also navigate through connections to other characters. 
    The website is very interactive, which makes it fun to learn more. You can 
    move the whole graphs of characters around to see them all, as well as zoom 
    in and out to see closer. You can also see a connected graph of movies. This 
    site has many ways to visualize all the information and is user-friendly and 
    easy to navigate.</p>
  <p>Although perhaps not up-to-date (although there is reasonable cause debate 
    on this topic), this website's visualization is truthful, functional, and beautiful. 
    Accurate information is given in a way that is pleasing to the eye and the 
    interactions work well and are easy to understand. It is also insightful and 
    enlightening. User's can learn more by navigating through the character or movie 
    graphs.</p>
